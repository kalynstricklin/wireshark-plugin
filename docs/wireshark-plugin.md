# Real-Time Suspicous Packet Prediction

This project demonstrates real-time network packet analysis using a Swing-based GUI, TShark, and a pre-trained machine learning model. The GUI allows users to either:

- Scan their local network in real-time using TShark

- Upload a PCAP file for batch analysis

Packets are processed and classified as suspicious or normal using the ML model, with results displayed in the GUI for easy monitoring and review.
